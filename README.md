!!! darkroom !!!

The goal of this project is to create a utility that can convert .heic files into .jpg files.  It quickly became more than that (as these things do) and is a more robust conversion tool that can handle the following file formats (for the most part):
- BMP: Windows Bitmap
- GIF: Graphics Interchange Format
- JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group
- PNG: Portable Network Graphics
- TIFF: Tagged Image File Format
- WEBP: WebP image format
- ICO: Windows Icon
- PDF: Portable Document Format
- PSD: Adobe Photoshop Document
- SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics
- HEIC: High Efficiency Image Format
- PICT: QuickDraw Picture Format
- PCD: Kodak Photo CD Image Format
- PFM: Portable FloatMap
- PBM: Portable Bitmap Format
- PGM: Portable Graymap Format
- PPM: Portable Pixmap Format
- PAM: Portable Arbitrary Map Format
- EXR: OpenEXR Image Format
- HDR: High Dynamic Range Image Format
- TGA: Targa Image Format
- XBM: X Windows System Bitmap
- XPM: X Windows System Pixmap

darkroom can "develop" your photos and convert your files from and to these formats.  Some formats will not convert to the others, but never fear!  darkroom will give you an error message about that letting you know.
